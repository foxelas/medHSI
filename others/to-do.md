## To Do  

### In matlab
- ~~Read HSI to .mat~~
- ~~Preview to sRGB~~
- ~~Normalize and Preprocess~~
- ~~Convert entire dataset to hdf5~~
- ~~Split in superpixels~~
- ~~Remove background~~
- ~~Apply dimension reduction on specimen pixels only~~
- ~~Find autocorr per superpixel~~
- Build SOM

### In python 
- Read hdf5 dataset
- Apply dimension reduction
- Build CNN
- Build autoencoder 

### Theory 
- Performance of CNN in small datasets 
- Generalization for medical systems
